## Regan's Senior Research Project

The objective of my project is to see which AI is the best for determining whether an email is a phishing email or not. I will use three popular AIs and a prompt that guides them into their decision, as well as providing a result on whether an email is phishing or not.

The prompt used for each LLM

Figure 1. The Accuracy of LLMs in Detecting Phishing Emails. A performance bar chart that shows each model’s accuracy with x being the model and y being the accuracy (in percent).

Table 1. A confusion matrix for each LLM. The tables show which predictions were correct or incorrect. This will show the false positives, true positives, false negatives, and the true negatives of the LLM

Figure 2. Example Screenshots. A screenshot of a phishing email example from the email database, and an example of a potential model explanation to go along with the example. 


The EPVME database was used for the phishing emails -> https://github.com/sunknighteric/EPVME-Dataset/blob/main/EPVME_1.zip
The Seven Phishing Emails database was used for the non-phishing emails -> https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Seven_Phishing_Email_Datasets/25432108
